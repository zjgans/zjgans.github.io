<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Xiaodan Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=voxznZAAAAAJ) (粱小丹) at [the Human Cyber Physical Intelligence Integration Lab (HCP-I2 Lab)](https://www.sysu-hcp.net/). I received my BS from Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof.[Qingling Cai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=-KcEiOAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I am also lucky to have opportunities to collaborate with [Calvin Yu-Chian Chen](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/info/1053/2659.htm) (Professor at Peking University).

My primary research interests lie in the areas of image generation and diffusion models, with a particular focus on instruction-based image editing. My work aims to enhance the capabilities of deep learning models to generate high-fidelity and controllable image content. By contributing to advancements in these fields, I want to make a significant impact on applications such as photography, human-computer interaction, advertising, and the gaming industry.
